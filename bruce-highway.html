<div><h2 id="help-is-on-its-way-for-queensland">Help is on its way for Queensland.</h2><p>As proud supporters of the Help Our Highway initiative, in partnership with News Corp Australia, NRMA Insurance welcomes the Federal Government's announcement to commit an additional $7.2 billion to upgrade and fix the Bruce Highway.</p><p>Queensland, you have been heard.</p><p>The latest funding announcement is a testament to the power of advocacy and the power of Help and follows several funding initiatives to help improve the Bruce Highway.</p><p>In May 2024 we welcomed the Federal Government's $467 million budget boost for the Bruce Highway, which followed their $21 million commitment to a National Road Safety Data Hub.</p><p>With our research showing that 58% of drivers have been negatively impacted on the Bruce Highway, we believe all Queenslanders deserve to be safe both on and off the road.</p><p>We thank you for sharing your stories, and while this is a huge win for all Queenslanders – we know there is still a long road ahead.</p></div>
<div><h2 id="the-truth-about-the-bruce">THE TRUTH ABOUT THE BRUCE</h2><p>A name that evokes a response from almost every Queenslander.</p><p>The Bruce Highway.</p><p>For some it's sheer frustration, for others it's a reminder of lives lost and for many it's anger at the lack of progress when it comes to fixing Australia's longest and arguably most unsafe highways.</p><p>The 1,670 kilometres stretch from Brisbane to Cairns bears not just the weight of Queensland's busiest traffic flow, with over 100,000 vehicles daily, but a history of accidents, flooding, congestion, and the promise of upgrades.</p><p>This critical corridor isn't just used to carry freight, it connects us to our friends and families, it connects communities. It is one of Queensland's most important roads. And, also one of the most dangerous.</p></div>

<div><h2 id="help-our-highway">HELP OUR HIGHWAY</h2><p>For almost 100 years, NRMA Insurance has helped Australians stay safe on and off the road. As a company that stands for Help, we've seen first-hand the devastation a spate of natural disasters has had on the community, homes, cars and on infrastructure - including the Bruce Highway. Most recently what's been described as the worst floods in the state's history saw the Highway cut off, at many points, for many days and in both directions.</p><p>Our figures show that more help is needed to make this road safer for drivers And that's why NRMA Insurance is a proud supporter of the 'Help Our Highway' initiative.</p></div>

<div><h2 id="the-results-are-in-queensland-has-spoken">THE RESULTS ARE IN, QUEENSLAND HAS SPOKEN</h2><p>NRMA Insurance surveyed more than 1,000 Queenslanders and the results were staggering. We uncovered that <strong>58%</strong> of drivers have been negatively impacted traveling on the Bruce Highway. While <strong>34%</strong> expressed dissatisfaction with the state of the road. Devastatingly, the survey also revealed 1 in 10 has been involved or impacted by a fatality on the highway.</p></div>
<div><h2 id="the-forecast-is-bleak">THE FORECAST IS BLEAK</h2><blockquote>
<h3 id="say-the-bruce-cant-handle-wild-weather"><strong>70% say the Bruce can't handle wild weather.</strong></h3>
</blockquote><p>The Bruce has had its fair share of widespread flooding over the years. Motorists are left stranded; potholes grow deeper and communities grow more frustrated. Major towns such as Townsville and Mackay are cut off, impacting tourism, supply chains and of course getting help to those who need it. Economically this lifeline can literally drown small business. And too many to mention have lost their lives and loved ones.</p><p>In recent months, Queensland has been hit by multiple events including Ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper, the Christmas and New Year storms that ravaged southeast Queensland, Ex-Tropical Cyclone Kirrily in the north and the severe rainfall and flooding early this year which saw 12 sections of the Bruce Highway blocked due to the severe weather.</p><p>The longstanding challenges of traffic congestion, substandard road conditions and safety persist as significant worries. Particularly notorious is the stretch from the Sunshine Coast to Gympie, widely regarded as the highway's most perilous segment, closely followed by the sections from Gympie to Bundaberg and Rockhampton.</p></div>

</blockquote><p>Our survey shows that more than half of Queenslanders have witnessed an accident on the Bruce Highway and a frightening <strong>one in three</strong> people are dissatisfied or extremely dissatisfied with the nation's longest route.</p><p>According to the Courier Mail, in just a four-year period, crashes along the notorious Bruce Highway claimed the lives of <strong>134 people</strong> and the toll is continuing to rise.</p><p>The Mail also sites that crashes on the problem-plagued Bruce Highway have increased by more than <strong>60 per cent</strong> since 2019 and almost <strong>5000 people</strong> have been injured along the deadly stretch over five years.</p><p>Although the government has improved 11-kilometres of expanded highway between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, Queenslanders still need improvements for safer roads along the highway's most dangerous stretch of road from the Sunshine Coast to Gympie and Gympie to Bundaberg and Rockhampton.</p></div>

<div><h2 id="the-road-to-recovery">THE ROAD TO RECOVERY</h2><p>We know that when it comes to keeping Queenslanders safe, more needs to be done and soon. Our survey reveals the Top 5 priorities you want addressed.</p><ol>
<li>Widening high-priority sections of the road.</li>
<li>Upgrading overtaking lanes for safer passing opportunities.</li>
<li>Implementing general improvements to enhance overall road quality.</li>
<li>Enhancing maintenance efforts to repair potholes and prevent road hazards.</li>
<li>Enforcing measures to improve sections of the road prone to flooding, reducing the risk for motorists.</li>
</ol><p>Understandably, the top-voted technology solution aimed at enhancing motorists' safety is real-time weather, flooding, and pothole warnings, closely followed by real-time estimated travel time and variable speed limits adjusted according to traffic conditions.</p></div>
